## Goal Recap:
Things I worked on:
- Code reviews
- Added backend ability to create chats between 2 parties (backend support only for now)
- Chats are encrypted with AES keys, which are encrypted by both party's RSA public keys so they can be accessed by either party (backend support only for now)
- Both parties have the ability to decrypt, append new messages, and re-encrypt chats to act as a secure messaging platform to accompany videos (backend support only for now)
- Research / attempts at automating testcases with github actions. Stuck here for now.
  
Tasks from the project board relevant to things I worked on:
- Creating chats (almost done pending testcases being written)
- Encryption / decryption of chats (almost done pending testcases being written)

## Goal Recap:
Things I worked on:
- Finished entire backend for messaging aside from testcases (these will be there next week)
