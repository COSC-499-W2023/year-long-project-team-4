## Goal Recap:
The features that were mine to complete this week were:
- Project Charter, Sections 3 & 4

Tasks from the Project Board:
- Review front end tech stack
- Review entire project charter (feature list, and milestones)
- Finish section 3 and 4 of the project charter

Completed:
- Review front end tech stack
- Review entire project charter (feature list, and milestones)
- Finish section 3 and 4 of the project charter

Additional Context:
- This was a light week.
- We had discussions to divide the feature list and get a general sense of which members will work on which tasks.
- We created the git repo & added items to the project board.
